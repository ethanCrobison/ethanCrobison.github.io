<strong>UI Programming Intern</strong>
| SomaSim, LLC.
| summer 2017
</span></p>

<p>The eponymous undertaking was a port of the desktop version of <em>Project
Highrise</em> to work on Android tablets and iPads. The UI conversion that
happened here also laid the foundation for the porting of the game to
consoles.</p>

<!-- [TODO .gif of the gameplay, highlight the diffs?] -->

<p>On the one hand, this project was an extension of the interning that I
did in the preceding months: I did a lot of miscellaneous work on a
bunch of different parts of the codebase, tweaking and poking and
prodding and implementing features. On the other hand, this project had
idiosyncracies about it that led to me spending <em>copious</em> amounts of
time messing about with Unity UI elements. Really, if the first half of
my <em>Project Highrise</em> experience was about general-purpose programming
and learning to collaborate with team members, then this chunk was all
about diving deep on a fairly limited aspect of the game development
process.</p>
