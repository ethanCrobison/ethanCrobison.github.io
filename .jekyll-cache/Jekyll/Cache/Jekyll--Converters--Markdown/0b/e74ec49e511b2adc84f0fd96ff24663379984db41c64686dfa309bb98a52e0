<p>I can’t say much about this one yet, but I’m very excited for the moment
when I can. I can, however, say these two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I learned a heck of a lot about designing systems top-to-bottom.
Software engineering is hard work!</li>
  <li>The AI work that I did during this period forms the backbone for my
