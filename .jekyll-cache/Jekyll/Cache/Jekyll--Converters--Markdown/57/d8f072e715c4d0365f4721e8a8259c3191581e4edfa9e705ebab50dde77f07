I"…<h1 id="principles-of-this-site">Principles of this site</h1>

<p>This site is constructed in (loose) adherence to some principles. It is</p>

<ul>
  <li>(in) Markdown</li>
</ul>

<p>The content, when possible, is written in markdown. It lends itself to
being read exactly as it shows up, which I consider an important
feature.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static</li>
</ul>

<p>This website is statically generated. That is, I write content, I churn
it through some preprocessing to create pages that browsers can handle,
and I host those pages. Everyone gets the same experience, as opposed to
dynamically serving different content to different folks.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have any intrinsic gripes with dynamic content, itâ€™s just not
necessary for a website like this. But keeping a site static helps to
reduce its carbon footprint, among other things. For an excellent
discussion of low tech internet, <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">I recommend this online
magazine</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tiny</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, and for a lot of the same arguments made arguing for static
pages, Iâ€™ve tried to keep the size of the individual pages on this
website pretty small.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Archival</li>
</ul>

<p>As of May 1st, 2020, any page that you link to from this site will link
to something semantically similar forever. If you need to reference
something before then (I doubt it, but just in case), the entire site
and its sordid history can be <a href="https://github.com/ethanrobison/ethanrobison.github.io">found on my github</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accessible</li>
</ul>

<p>This site strives to comply with the accessibility guidelines
of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Didactic</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything I can do, you can do better. Piece by painstaking piece, this
website and all of its content will be documented for pedagogical
purposes.</p>
