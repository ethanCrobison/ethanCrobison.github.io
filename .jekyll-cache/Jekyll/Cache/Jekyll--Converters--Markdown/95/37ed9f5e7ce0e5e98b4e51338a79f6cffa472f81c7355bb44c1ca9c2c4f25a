<p><em>Project Highrise</em> is a skyscraper construction and management sim from
<a href="http://www.somasim.com/blog/">SomaSim, LLC</a>.</p>

<!-- [TODO .gif of gameplay] -->

<p>I worked on this project as an intern doing gameplay programming,
feature requests, and debugging. I picked up a ton of practical
programming knowledge in three areas that donâ€™t get a lot of love in
undergraduate CS curricula:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Version controlâ€”I learned a lot about git in this stretch. A
retroactive apology to all of my professors who had to manually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git
reset --hard</code> my homework repositories.</li>
  <li>Object oriented programmingâ€”turns out nothing beats being forced to
think about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Virtual</code> keyword on a daily basis for learning what
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Virtual</code> keyword does.</li>
  <li>Familization with a codebaseâ€”the PH codebase was around 100K SLOC,
and some of the bits and pieces were pretty bespoke. I had to work
with all of it, which means that I had to get to know all of it.</li>
</ol>
