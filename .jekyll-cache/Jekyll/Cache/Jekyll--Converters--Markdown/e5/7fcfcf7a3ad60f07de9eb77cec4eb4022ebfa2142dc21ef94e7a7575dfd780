<p>I started a pretty substantial job search around the time of this page&#8217;s
original creation (mid 2020). This meant that I needed to create and
update everyone&#8217;s two favorite documents, my CV and my resume. Of
course, a resume&#8217;s details are ostensibly a subset of a CV&#8217;s, which
means that I thought the sensible thing to do was to whip up a CV for
the first time in my life and delete accordingly to create a resume.
The contents of a CV are dynamically compiled as one completes projects,
earns new qualifications, &amp;c. I have two problems with this:</p>

<p><strong>1. I&#8217;m a touch reactive about updating my professional records.</strong> I
almost never update my resume/CV until it&#8217;s time to do a big job search.
This means that an already dreadful process is made worse, and I&#8217;m
disinclined to do it.</p>

<p><strong>2. I have multiple &#8220;canonical&#8221; sources of information about myself.</strong>
Lots of people have a CV and a website and a resume, at least, which
means that lots of people have three (3!) places where they have to
update things. I can barely handle one (1!) place!</p>

<p>Enter AutoCV, a tool for scraping my website&#8217;s frontmatter for certain,
specially formatted information, then automatically creating a
correctly-formatted YAML file <em>with</em> that information. Then, I write a
pair of LaTeX templates for a CV and a resume and build both with
pandoc. Bam! All three documents use the same ground truth. Now, I write
project/skill information down in one place, and it gets automagically
transformed into my professional documentation, and recruiters are none
the wiser that I&#8217;m a lazy bum who only wrote his information down once
(twice, if you count uploading a resume and then re-entering its info on
the next page).</p>
