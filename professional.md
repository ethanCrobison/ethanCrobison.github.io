A collection of the game development work I've done in a professional
capacity (where someone thought it fitting to offer me pecuniary
compensation). In chronological order.

## Unannounced Project

<span class="gray">
__AI Programmer__
| SomaSim, LLC.
| spring 2019 through winter 2019
</span>

I can't say much about this one yet, but I'm very excited for the moment
when I can. I can, however, say these two things:

1. I learned a heck of a lot about designing systems top-to-bottom.
   Software engineering is hard work!
2. The AI work that I did during this period forms the backbone for my
   dissertation research. More on that later. <!-- TODO link to diss stuff -->

## Project Highrise (Tablet Edition)

<span class="gray">
__UI Programming Intern__
| SomaSim, LLC.
| summer 2017
</span>

The eponymous undertaking was a port of the desktop version of _Project
Highrise_ to work on Android tablets and iPads. The UI conversion that
happened here also laid the foundation for the porting of the game to
consoles.

[TODO .gif of the gameplay, highlight the diffs?]

On the one hand, this project was an extension of the interning that I
did in the preceding months: I did a lot of miscellaneous work on a
bunch of different parts of the codebase, tweaking and poking and
prodding and implementing features. On the other hand, this project had
idiosyncracies about it that led to me spending _copious_ amounts of
time messing about with Unity UI elements. Really, if the first half of
my _Project Highrise_ experience was about general-purpose programming
and learning to collaborate with team members, then this chunk was all
about diving deep on a fairly limited aspect of the game development
process.

_Project Highrise_ for mobile can be downloaded on the [Google Play
Store][1] or the [Apple Store][2].

## Project Highrise (Desktop Edition)


<span class="gray">
__Programming Intern__
| SomaSim, LLC.
| fall 2016 through spring 2017
</span>

_Project Highrise_ is a skyscraper construction and management sim from
[SomaSim, LLC](http://www.somasim.com/blog/).

[TODO .gif of gameplay]

I worked on this project as an intern doing gameplay programming,
feature requests, and debugging. I picked up a ton of practical
programming knowledge in three areas that don't get a lot of love in
undergraduate CS curricula:

1. Version control---I learned a lot about git in this stretch. A
   retroactive apology to all of my professors who had to manually `git
   reset --hard` my homework repositories.
2. Object oriented programming---turns out nothing beats being forced to
   think about the `Virtual` keyword on a daily basis for learning what
   the `Virtual` keyword does.
3. Familization with a codebase---the PH codebase was around 100K SLOC,
   and some of the bits and pieces were pretty bespoke. I had to work
   with all of it, which means that I had to get to know all of it.

_Project Highrise_ can be found on its [Steam Page][3].
