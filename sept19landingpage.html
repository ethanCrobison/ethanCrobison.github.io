		<p>This page is going to be a lovely collection of all of the webpages that I make this month.</p>

		<p>Each day, I'm going to try to do a different gimmick for the page in question. At the end of it all, I'll have quite the smorgasboard of random things to polish.</p>

		<p>Today's gimmick is: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp">accordions!</a></p>

		<p>Tomorrow's gimmick will be: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp">flip cards!</a></p>
