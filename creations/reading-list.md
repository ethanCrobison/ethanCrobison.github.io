## Slouching Towards Bethlehem

__Joan Didion, 1968__. All about that strange, unending, end-of-an-era
era, the late 1960s. "Goodbye to All That" is a masterpiece on what it
is to move to a certain mythologized east coast city.

Read it for sublime prose and to feel a pang of nostalgia for a time
when things were actually quite bad, and anyway you weren't even alive
then, buckaroo.

## Notes from No-man's Land

__Eula Biss, 2009__. What if a White woman wrote about race? What if
that book was actually really good?

Also features an essay titled "Goodbye to All That," in direct reference
and response to the Didion piece.

Read it for a baring of (someone else's) soul, and for an unpacking of
Just What Is Wrong with Us These Days, a redux.

## The Old Man and the Sea

__Ernest Hemmingway, 1951__. A tiny novel. A tiny cast. A man's efforts
to catch a break. It's about a fisherman, if you couldn't guess.

Read it to have someone to root for, and to pass a quiet albeit
emotional evening.

## Truckers

__Terry Pratchett, 1989__. All about nomes, who are tiny and who can't
quite figure out their place in the universe. Part of the _Bromeliad_
trilogy, which is excellent.

A quote from _Wings_, the third book, to get your brain thinkin'

> I told her we were going to get married, and all she could talk about
> was frogs. She said there's these hills where it's hot and rains all
> the time, and in the rainforests there are these very tall trees and
> right in the top branches of the trees there are these like great big
> flowers called...  bromeliads, I think, and water gets into the
> flowers and makes little pools and there's a type of frog that lays
> eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch, and grow into new frogs and
> these little frogs live their whole lives in the flowers right at the
> top of the trees and don't even know about the ground, and once you
> know the world is full of things like that, your life is never the
> same.

Read _Truckers_ (and the other two) to expand your mind.

## The Three-Body Problem

__Cixin Liu, 2008__. A sci-fi novel like few others. Concerns itself
principally with post-revolution China and how it handles the notion of
Life Out There. An excellent science fiction piece, an also a stunning
work of translation by Ken Liu.

Includes one of my favorite thoughts on translation (by Ken Liu, not the
author): that the goal of translation is to make the reader feel that
their reading the translated _from_ language in the translated _to_
language.

Read it to wonder just how alone we are in the universe, and for a
pleasnt sense of bewilderment.

## The House of the Spirits

__Isabel Allende,1982__. This is a hard novel to pin down, so I'll
suffice with some of its story elements:

- Magical realism
- Family relationships
- Political unrest and upheaval
- Class mobility
- Gender roles

It's a weird one, but it's excellent. Read it to be a touch confused,
even if you think you really know what's going on, maybe? And to
rekindle your sense of wonder in the ordinary.
