## Project Highrise (Desktop Edition)

_Project Highrise_ is a skyscraper construction and management sim from
[SomaSim, LLC](http://www.somasim.com/blog/).

I worked on this project as an intern doing gameplay programming,
feature requests, and debugging. I picked up a ton of practical
programming knowledge in three areas that don't get a lot of love in
undergraduate CS curricula:

1. Version control---I learned a lot about git in this stretch. A
   retroactive apology to all of my professors who had to manually `git
   reset --hard` my homework repositories.
2. Object oriented programming---turns out nothing beats being forced to
   think about the `Virtual` keyword on a daily basis for learning what
   the `Virtual` keyword does.
3. Familization with a codebase---the PH codebase was around 100K SLOC,
   and some of the bits and pieces were pretty bespoke. I had to work
   with all of it, which means that I had to get to know all of it.

_Project Highrise_ can be found on its [Steam Page][3].
