I can't say much about this one yet, but I'm very excited for the moment
when I can. I can, however, say these two things:

1. I learned a heck of a lot about designing systems top-to-bottom.
   Software engineering is hard work!
2. The AI work that I did during this period forms the backbone for my
   dissertation research. More on that later. <!-- TODO link to diss stuff -->
