## Project Highrise (Tablet Edition)

<span class="gray">
__UI Programming Intern__
| SomaSim, LLC.
| summer 2017
</span>

The eponymous undertaking was a port of the desktop version of _Project
Highrise_ to work on Android tablets and iPads. The UI conversion that
happened here also laid the foundation for the porting of the game to
consoles.

[TODO .gif of the gameplay, highlight the diffs?]

On the one hand, this project was an extension of the interning that I
did in the preceding months: I did a lot of miscellaneous work on a
bunch of different parts of the codebase, tweaking and poking and
prodding and implementing features. On the other hand, this project had
idiosyncracies about it that led to me spending _copious_ amounts of
time messing about with Unity UI elements. Really, if the first half of
my _Project Highrise_ experience was about general-purpose programming
and learning to collaborate with team members, then this chunk was all
about diving deep on a fairly limited aspect of the game development
process.

_Project Highrise_ for mobile can be downloaded on the [Google Play
Store][1] or the [Apple Store][2].
