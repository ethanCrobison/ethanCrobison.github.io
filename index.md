# Hello

I'm Ethan. I'm an AI engineer at Naughty Dog.

I'm also a PhD dropout (don't worry, I got a masters out of it) from
Northwestern University, where I studied experimental game AI with Ian
Horswill.

I spend a lot of my time thinking (and some of it writing) about what
the future of game AI could look like.

Drop me a line: {my first name}@{this domain}
