# When We Talk About Games

Games are really hard.<sup>[Citation needed]</sup>


Let's get down to brass tacks.

# Why We Need a Framework (and Why We Don't)

There aren't many terms that people agree on, semantically, in games. Terms like
__level__ and __power-up__ _generally_ point towards the same thing[^1] and you can
safely use them in to talk about elements of different games, even if those games have
different genres.

[^1]:
    Meaning that people tend to agree "yes, that thing is a power-up," or "this game
    has _N_ levels," and things like that.


# How it Shakes Out

mechanics
: the rules of the game
: the internal "physics" of the game

dynamics
: how the game interacts with itself
: how the game interacts with its players
: how the players interact with each other

aesthetics
: how the game

#### Mechanics

__Mechanics__ are the rules of the game, its internal physics (figuratively or
literally). They define what the fundamental internal elements of a game are, the in-game
names for things, how the game responds to player action, and so on. Examples (example
games in parentheses) include:

- Each player gets four actions per turn (_Pandemic_).
- Pressing the A button causes the player character to jump. A short press leads to a
  small hop while a longer press is more of a leap (_Megaman_).
- Players may only discard a card to gain a unit of time if there is at least one token
  in the box (_Hanabi_).

...and so on.

Mechanics are _how_ a game works. They're often the building blocks of our pedagogical
structures for new players ("press the bumper while turning to power slide") and they
help us by being grounded in specificsâ€”things have names, things respond in certain ways.

Mechanics aren't the whole game, however; there is more to being good at _Call of Duty_
than just knowing that headshots do more damage. Enter _dynamics_.

#### Dynamics

__Dynamics__ are the interactions between the player and the game's mechanics, the
interactions among the game mechanics, and the interactions among the players.

...

Consider as a grounding example poker (in general, or you may prefer to think of _texas
hold 'em_). The (general) rules to poker are simple, and involve things like betting,
folding, and (depending on the variant) discarding and gaining new cards.

You may be inclined to point out that I didn't mention "bluffing" or "maintaining a poker
face" or any of the parts of poker that people talk about as _defining the game_. This is
because, while absolutely critical to being a skilled player, and while foundational to
why the game is enjoyable for many people; the subtle and deceptive parts of poker
_aren't part of its rules_.<sup>\*</sup>

Seriously. There are no rules in poker that say that whether or not you win a round, or
are playing legally (or illegally), or whether you get more chips or fewer, or any of
that; is dependent on whether you maintained a poker face. Getting excited and saying,
"I've got a great card," doesn't disqualify you from winning the round. _Not_ doing this
doesn't disqualify you either.

And yet. And yet the characterizing strategy of the game, the first "skill" that players
are taught is keeping a poker face and learning how to bluff. This is because these
skills are part of the _dynamics_ of poker; they represent _how_ one should play the
game. That is, how one should comport oneself, what specific elements and situtations are
favorable, or unlikely, or suspicious, or otherwise.

In other words, the specific rules of the game don't tell you to bluff, but no poker
coach would ever leave it out of their curriculum.
