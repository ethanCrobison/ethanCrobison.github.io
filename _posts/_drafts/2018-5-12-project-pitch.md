# A Remake

The original tagline was, "A fragile academic from the school of evocation [sic] descends
deep into a danger-filled crypt to find untold knowledge and treasure."

That actually sounds kind of awesome. You've got the bookish type who knows who to summon
all sorts of badass things, and they're going on a quest to go deep into a crypt filled
with arcane secrets and all sorts of wealth.

# The Pitch

Here's the new pitch: it's a hero-style RTS game with procedurally generated dungeons,
clever AI, and rich histories and secrets. Combat is fast-paced and tactical, with lots
of spell-slinging and repositioning. Learn and write new spells to your spellbook.
Upgrade your monsters (choose wisely, though, as magical ink is scarce) and find
treasure. Study textbooks and tattoo yourself to become even more of an unstoppable
force.


# The Plan

Here's my new outline of things to do:

1. World

  a. Overworld

  b. Dungeon

  c. History

2. Enemies

  a. Generation

  b. AI

3. Minions

  a. Generation

  b. AI

4. Character

  a. Input

  b. Spellcasting

  c. Leveling your Character

  d. Other Progression Mechanics

5. UI

6. Architecture

  a. Saving/Loading


# Magic

Works by channeling the actions of the spirits that you summon. Summoning more powerful
spirits will enable you to cast more powerful spells.

Most spirits can cast multiple spells, although the specific combination varies from
spirit to spirit. You can level up spirits and teach them new techniques?
