Whatever you're practicing (here I'll talk mostly about programming and game design, but
I'll make the unsubstantiated claim that this advice applies to "anything"), the trick
seems to be to "read" and "write" as much as you can. For me, "reading" means playing a
lot of games, watching a lot of talks about game design, etc. "Writing" means making a
lot of games and creating a lot of programs.


## Why

#### Why should you consume a lot?

For most fields, there's a lot to consume. Certain prodigies (see some famous composers)
can get away with just reinventing the wheel in a way that no one has ever seen before,
and that's fine if that's your shtick.\* For the rest of us (for most of us), it's
important to learn the rules so that we can break them later. Neil Gaiman (and a good
deal of other smart folks) talks about this in one of his essays in the collection, _The
View from the Cheap Seats_.

The only way to learn the rules is to see what other people are saying about them. This
could be implicitly, by consuming examples where people follow them (or break them, since
the twisting of a thing emphasizes your broken expectations); or explicitly, by reading
metacommentary where people write their thoughts on the subject itself. Either way, you
need to see the lay of the land before you can chart your own path.

\* Most of these prodigies just kind of... _did_ their work. Someone who needs
instruction to seek direction (which, I emphasize, is the overwhelming majority of
people) is probably not going to reinvent the wheel. You can be a brilliant member of
your community without being Beethoven.


#### Why should you produce a lot?

It's important to have a safe space to be mediocre. There's a lot of writing and artistic
advice that boils down to "the first 10,000 things you make will be awful." There's
similar advice on the importance of having a place to safely suck. (If I find the post
that inspired this comment, I'll post it, but it had to do with webcomics.) In any case,
meaningful practice (and a lot of it) seems to be the trick to becoming a wizard.

You need to start doing that practice early. 


#### Why should you reflect a lot?

## What

#### What should you consume?


I could say that you should consume _everything_, because you never know what might be
handy. This is... sort of true. The problem is that "everything" is a bit hefty. Usually,
when people say that you should consume "everything," they mean to make efforts to let
everything seem legitimate, to be _willing_ to consume any and all material. You'll still
have to be the judge of what you pick, though, since you only have so much time. In that
case, just pick what seems interesting.

#### What should you produce?

Produce what's interesting to you. Produce what you want to get better at making. Your
reasons for wanting to improve are your own, but I want to emphasize that you should make
what you want to get good at making, because you will. Eventually.

#### (On) What should you reflect?


## etc.

Concerning reflection, take a look at what you spend a lot of time consuming. Do you
love watching videos on League of Legends strategy? Have you read every Wikipedia page on
linguistics? Listen to nothing but podcasts on the Vietnam War?

If metacognition shows that you're investing a lot of time into a particular subject,
consider, well, spending more time on it. Consider producing content on it. Passion (as
shown by our dedication, as shown by our time spent on something) is an appreciable chunk
of progress.
