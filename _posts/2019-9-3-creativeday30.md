I started today's contribution yesterday, but got side-tracked by the prospect of board
games. We're back on the wagon today, though.

It's got some rough spots, but it uses the same css as the whole site eventually well, so
that's nice and incremental. Problem areas definitely include copy-pasting html and the
fact that things are still really cringey right now. Eventually, I hope, even these blog
posts will get turned into a custom-made joint. For now, though, I stick with Jekyll.

Back tomorrow with flip cards for the twenty-some stories I wrote in August.
