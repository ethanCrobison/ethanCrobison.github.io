Down to brass tacks.

# 1

I've been reading Fabien Sandglard's [Game Engine Black
Book](http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/index.html), which is an (nearly line-by-line)
unpacking of the game Wolfenstein 3D. There's so much interesting history and trivia
packed alongside useful (or archaic) technical tricks. There's also the best description
of floating point that I've ever seen. You can get a dead tree version, but the author
makes a pittance off of that. Instead, you can get a digital copy and donate what you
want. Strong recommend.

It was savagely cold this Wednesday. Wind chill in the -40s or so cold. Taking off my
gloves to take a picture with my phone and my hands started to hurt in _seconds_ cold.
Most of the city—including, to much delight—Northwestern was cancelled for a day as
people just tried to survive. I didn't go outside, except to look at the lake and snap
aforementioned picture:

I've been at work making this shmup over the past week. Left to do for week one (given my
initial plan of action, which I intend on sticking to, thank you very much):

- "Tutorial" boss and accompanying UI

- Enemies strengthening over time; the player strengthening as they kill enemies

Tomorrow is my last hacking day of the week, so I'll make the most of it. Tomorrow is
also screenshot Saturday, so I'll be Tweeting the first screenshot thereof. Eep.

Since it's February, I've (finally) moved on from Vagante.[^1] The plan is to do Bastion
and Transistor for the game(s) of the month, although this was derailed for this evening
as neither game would load. So, I played Gorogoa instead.[^2] It was _incredible_. I'll
have plenty to say in the review of the game, but the short version is that I spent most
of the playthrough mouth agape.

I love shaders. For a long time I've avoided them as some kind of black magic. These last
few days I sat down and went through a brief tutorial and my mind is _blown_ with them.
They can do so much with just a bit of cleverness, and they are hella fast. I'll take
perf and cool effects for the price of a little bit of obscurity. Huh, maybe I should
do more C++ programming... Unreal eventually, I suppose. Especially if I want a job...

I got a new water bottle this Sunday at Chicago's Donut Fest. This is a big deal for me,
as my previous water bottle was almost 9 years old. I'm trying to decide if I'm going to
donate it (probably will) or give it a viking funeral (also a good and fun idea).

# 7

The Circle Undone just released this week. It's the new expansion to Fantasy Flight
Games' Arkham Horror LCG, which is my favorite forking game ever. The next time you're in
a games store, take a gander to see if they have a demo copy. You won't be disappointed.

# Signing Off

Remember to get lots of sleep and practice your scales every day. Until next time.
