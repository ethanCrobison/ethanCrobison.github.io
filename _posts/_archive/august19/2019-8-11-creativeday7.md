A last-minute entry. It occurs to me, that if I want to write anything long-form, I
should probably be working somewhere other than r/writingprompts. A problem for the
future.

# Story

"The wages of sin, young man, is death," the shopkeeper said patiently. "You're not the
first to try to rob me, and you won't be the last."

"Shut up," he said, pointing his gun first at her and then at the bag on the counter.
"Fill the bag and you keep your life."

She shook her head sadly, and turned around to face the jars, vials, and asundry
knick-knacks and kitsch behind the counter.

"Any particular items catch your fancy?" she asked, turning her head to cock an eyebrow
in his general direction.

The sound of his hand hitting the counter and the frantic shaking of the gun were all she
got in reply.

She sighed, and started picking her favorite items off of the shelf. Some of them, she
knew, he was safe to steal. The Great Old Ones who were strapped for cash didn't always
find a way to end up un-strapped. But sufficiently many found themselves back on their
various feet, tentacles, and nebulous lower apendages. She had been the proprietor of
Pawn Stars Are Right for something like the whole of time, and things weren't about to
change now.

In any case, she had filled the sack. She turned around, and handed the nice young man
his bag of elder god personal effects. She had tried to only pick the ones that would be
left there forever, but forever was such an awfully long time...
