It sounds like a riddle: You'll do it the better part of a billion times in your life,
but you rarely pay it any mind—what is it?

There's a cliché about rivers, and how many times one gets to step into the same one.
There's a corresponding cliché that the person is just as apt to change as the water, and
it is in fact a two-way street. Of course, whether the human or the water is never the
same twice, both of these interpretations treat change as some discrete thing: is it the
woman changing, or the water? There's no third option here. There's no chance to
acknowledge the vast, churning chaos that engulfs these two tiny nothings.

The air above the stream is the same air that passes endlessly, in and out of the human's
lungs. A person has no choice but to breathe, lest they die. At the beginning of life,
there is a scream and a wail. At the end of life there is a choking cough. In between, a
person has no choice but to breathe. Lest they die.

This life-giving force rarely gets paid any mind, even as it endlessly shapes the world
around you. When's the last time you paid your breath any mind?
