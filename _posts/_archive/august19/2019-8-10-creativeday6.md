A shorter one. I wrote it in a bit of a hurry.

# Story

"That's it!" the girl shouted, "The beauty was inside me all along."

I nodded, vigorously. The blue paint I'd put on as part of my costume was had gone from
itchy to downright uncomfortable over the course of the last few hours, but that was the
least of my problems.

"Okay, genie," the girl said, looking me dead in my not-so-magical eyes, "I think we've
done enough magic for today. You can go back into your bottle, or whatever it is that you
need to do."

"Right..." I said, "do you mind if I, uh, step outside for some fresh air? I haven't been
outside, you know, outside of my eternal prison, for a couple thousand years."

"Oh, okay, sure," she said, nodding and putting the "magic lamp" down on the table.

"I'll be back in a jiffy," I said, "It's not like I can just up and leave you, right,
master?"

I winked, and she looked uneasily at me. Trying not to overstay my welcome, I quickly
ducked out the door. I needed a plan, and fast. Whoever made that duffel bag full of
money fall out of the sky, it sure as hell wasn't me, and I sure as hell didn't want to
be around when they came back for it.
