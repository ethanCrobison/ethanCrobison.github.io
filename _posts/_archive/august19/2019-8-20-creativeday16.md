# Story

The dock was made of cold concrete, and it stretched out into the blackness of space. The
dark brutalism of the transport ship lay berthed and beached as the line of people poured
out. The sigil of the Corporation painted on the bow of the transport matched that on the
sleeves of the dock workers. Some of them held clipboards, some tools of varying utility.
They clearly expected no trouble, even if their movements had a moderate frenzy to them.

Badr watched their people step onto the platform. The instructions they had been given
had told—commanded, really—them to organize into groups of 16, and to line those square
groups up alongside the docks. Badr had told their people to disregard the instructions,
and their people had disregarded them heartily.

The dock workers were confused. They were used to new arrivals' obedience, and hadn't
expected anything approaching "work." One of them walked up to Badr, whose yellow
jumpsuit was easy to pick out from the crowd of gray surrounding them.

"Um, Captain, would you mind getting your crew in line?" the worker asked, submissive
more out of shock than respect.

Badr reached their hand out and pulled the worked closer by the arm. "Listen carefully,
and my people won't you any trouble."

The worker tried to pull his arm back, but Badr tightened their grip. The worker winced
under the pressure.

"We don't work for the Corporation, and we certainly aren't going to bow down to their
demands."

By now more workers were watching. The former passengers of the transport stirred
restlessly.

"Listen closely!" Badr shouted to the gathering crowd, "We've come to liberate this
planet from the rule of the Corporation. We are no one's property, whatever lies the
Corp has shoved down your throats. We outnumber you 30 to 1, and this planet belongs to
us now."

Some of the workers looked like they wanted to run. But where would they go? By now both
ends of the dock were flooded with the new arrivals.

"You have a choice," Badr said, "You can join us, and we can work together to take our
revenge on the corporation and their oppression. Or, you can climb aboard the transport
vessel and make your way on your own. Whatever choice you make, be both wise and swift.
We will be generous only once."

The workers were left with a choice, then: to join this unknown firebrand and work to
take down the organization that ruled most of the galaxy; or to risk the wrath of this
lot of hard-faced wayfarers and strike out for parts unknown.
