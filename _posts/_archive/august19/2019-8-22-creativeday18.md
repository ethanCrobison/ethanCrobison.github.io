Something here, but as a gimmick.

# Story

"Hey guys, what's up?" Richard had a banana in one hand and was wiping his other on the
hem of his tattered cloak.

Conquest looked over at him from atop his towering white steed and grunted.

Death sighed, "hey, Richard."

Famine said nothing.

War was all shouts, as usual: "Richie! What's going on, man?"

Richard, who was never sure if War was pulling his immortal leg—he was never sure if any
of them were pulling his leg, to be honest—gave a half-grin and returned War's
out-stretched fistbump-in-the-waiting.

"We're, um, just finishing up," Death said, looking pointedly at the other three.

"Yeah, uh, I'm gonna go do my own thing," Famine said, already leading his horse off to
parts unknown. He faded into the aether and was gone.

"Me, too, man," said Death, pulling a similar stunt. Conquest was already gone, not being
much for salutations.

Richard looked at War. "You doing anything right now?" he asked, the half-grin still on
his face.

"Nah, man," he said. "Wanna lay waste to some mortals? Got any weed on you?"

Richard tossed a pouch over. War sure could smoke weed; it was all he ever wanted to do when they hung out.

The two rode through the villages of the earth, and War and Richard slaughtered the weak
and drove the strong mad with bloodlust. The skies turned black and the rivers and oceans
boiled with their belligerence. Fire and brimstone rained down from above, and death and
destruction overtook the lives of the mortals who inhabited the earth.

When they had finished, they were both pleasantly stoned. Richard looked over at War and
thought himself lucky to have a friend like that. War looked over at Richard and thought
himself lucky to know a guy who had good dope practically falling out of his asshole.

"Yo, man," Richard said, holding his hands out to hold the imaginary basketball of weed
haze, his eyes slitted nearly shut. "you ever just feel your head get too small, man?"

War looked over. He was stoned, too, but he knew better than to say anything. Richard was
a weird dude to begin with, but when he got toasted it was usually better to just let it
wash over you. They rode on.

Conquest, Famine, and Death looked at each other over the fire. Theirs was a meeting of
darkness and suffering.

"Once again," Famine said, his gaunt features twisting into frustration, "we can't just
get rid of him. He's as much a part of God's plan as the rest of us. There will always be
the judgment of Death, of Conquest, of War, of Famine, and of Richard."

"But he's such a fucking dork," Conquest said. His colossal hands were wrapped around a
greasy shank of roast lamb.

"Dork or not, Conquest, he is one of us. His power is perhaps unmatched, and when the
end of days comes, he will prove a valuable asset. There is nothing—"

Famine was interrupted by the sound of crashing in the back of the house. "I'm okay!" a
voice, clearly not okay, yelled from the kitchen. They found Richard lying on the ground
in his underwear, a box of pizza rolls spilled on the floor around him.

They looked at each and sighed.
