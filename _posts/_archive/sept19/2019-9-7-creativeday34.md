Two things are enormously difficult:

- creating something every day when you don't have a series of convenient and specific
  prompts to go off of
- centering something in CSS

The former I have conquered by doing a wishlist of pages for my website. A lame pass each
for the following:

- contact
- colophon
- status
- resum√©
- teaching
- professional projects
- personal projects
- publications
- blog

Today, we tried our hands at a really lame [contact page](/contact.html). My web design
philosophy has always been:

1. content
2. content
3. content
4. user experience
5. appearence

I figure there's not much point in the latter two without the first three. So, we're
putting it all up there, as gross as it's going to be, and we'll make it look cool and
nice after we've dumped it all over the floor.

In retrospect, this has been my M.O. for my whole life. My way of tidying up as a kid
(and now) was always to take everything off of the shelf, touch everything once and then
put it back. Marie Kondo, eat your heart out.

Tomorrow we tackle the colophon. We'll come back to gimmicks in a little while.
