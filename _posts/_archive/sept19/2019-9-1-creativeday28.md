A new month, a new category for daily creations. September gives us: a webpage a day! I
figure there's no better way to start doing web design than to start doing web design, so
here we are. Let's talk about how to make each day's goal SMART:

Specific: I will create and arrange the contents of a single-screen webpage each day.
Each webpage will highlight or curate a specific project I have done, hobby I participate
in, or topic that I consider intellectually stimulating. I am doing this to practice
creating, to deepen my web development skills, and to make my website reflect me as a
person.

Measureable: Each page needs a minimum of 200 words re: the topic at hand, or 100 words
and 2 pictures. Pages don't have to impress future employers, but they do have to give
them the information they might need to know what kind of things I've done.

Attainable: I have a list of simple website layouts (and the corresponding CSS tips and
tricks to put them into practice) that I can use for the majority of the project pages.

Realistic: I both want to do this (I enjoy making things, and I love making interactions)
and am able to do this (my standards for "done" afford a wide variety of qualities).

Timely: I get one day to make each page. I finish this particular run at the end of
September.

Will these webpages embarrass me in a few months? Hell, probably. This post itself is
already a bit cringey. But we make bad art so that one day we might make less bad art,
and we write lame blog posts about our bad art so that one day we might write lame blog
posts about our okay art.


Today's webpage theme: the year of creation project itself! A landing page for all of the
crap that I am making this year. The r/writing prompt stuff, this month's stuff (how
meta), and eventually everything else, too.
