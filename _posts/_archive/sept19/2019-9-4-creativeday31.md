This was a wild ride. I started off doing work on [this
page](https://www.ethanrobison.com/aug19landingpage), and in a certain sense that is
we're we stand.

But upon starting, I realized that it would really sick to copy-paste 25 things onto a
page, not to mention it would be really bad style. So, I took a look at Jekyll's
collections, which kicked off a rabbit hole that ended with me finally understanding how
Jekyll layouts work. So that's pretty neat.

In any case, I'll still be continuing on the trend of making a new webpage every day.
It's just that there's going to be a lot more crossover on the work than I had initially
expected. That's okay, because there's going to be a lot of use of Jekyll's cooler
features.

These features, and these pages, are still going to be inspired by gimmicks and and
topics. I'm still going to be showcasing things that I've done, and revamping my website
one page at a time. I'm still going to be trying out wild and crazy css tricks, and I'm
still going to be writing short posts about it all.

Today's gimmick was flip cards, which I am very into. Tomorrow's gimmick is a basic one,
but it should have good mileage for me: [dropdown navigation](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown_navbar.asp).
