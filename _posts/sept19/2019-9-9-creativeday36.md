I've discovered the beauty of collections. As a programmer (read: as a lazy person), I
hate copy-pasting things if I can help it. This means that I am elated to discover that
liquid/jekyll affords me the option of iterating through .yml data files to populate my
website's pages with content.

[Feast your eyes.](/teaching) Here's what the data for that looks like:

```yaml
