I had fun with this one.

# Story

"The real danger is password reuse," I laugh to myself, "And there's no password better
than the empty string."

The laptop in my hands is a distorted beast. It's lighter than its dimensions would
suggest, and the screen doesn't so much show an image as engrain oneâ€”I swear my brains
are getting a stir every time I open up a new file. On top of that, perhaps the most
important part, it's connected to the whole hive mind alien race batshit crazy internet.
Every single file a member of the hive mind might need, available for my taking.

Available for my taking because a computer belonging to a member of a hive mind alien
race would never need to hide anything from another member, would never be able to hide
anything, in fact. Not a password in sight. And they had human-like appendages, to boot.

I'm in the back of the AI-powered hover car I built from one of the easier blueprints on
the machine, on my way to meet a few of my good hacker buddies. We typically only chat
online, more for coveninece than any kind of secrecy. If I'm being perfectly honest, none
of is on our way towards infamy. We're more like, digital vandals, with a disbtribution
network of the whole goddammed planet.

I pull up outside the house of one of the crew. It's a dilapidated old shack with
boarded-up windows. More for convenience than for secrecy.

I knock on the front door, and push my way in.

"You guys, check this shit out," I'm saying even as I'm opening the laptop up and
switching it to visual projection mode.

What follows is a show-and-tell of epic proportions. Everything from impossibly dense
materials to free energy to super soldier serum. Everything my sci-fi brain could
conceive of, plus a litany of other zany ideas, contraptions, and asundry miracles.

Jack, the host of sorts, opens a file, one that I've seen before, and holds in it is mind
for a moment to see if he can figure it out.

"No use, man, I think that one's corrupted data."

_Or corrupting data_, a voice inside my head says. Jack's voice. I'm getting double
vision. What the hell is going on?

Jack's voice is running roughshod over my concentration, and in my shaky double vision I
see both myself and Jack putting our hands to our heads. I swear it feels like my body is
being pulled in two.

"You guys okay?" someone's voice asks. Yazeed, or Harry, or somebody.

We stand up. We look at each other. We look around the room. We speak in Jack's voice,
"You guys gotta see this file. I swear it's some kind of visual hallucinogenic or
something."

The other individuals look at each other nervously. Yazeed, braver than the rest of them,
sticks their hand out for the laptop.

We look at ourselves. Both of our bodies sit down, and watch patiently as three more 
join our ranks.
