Down to brass tacks.

# 1

Here's something to try: put a rubber band around your phone (the position isn't super
important). Then, count each time you pull out your phone to check it. You'll notice when
you do, because the rubber band gets in the way and makes your phone look weird. You may
find yourself noticing _when_ you pull your phone out. Here are some of mine:

- _After_ crossing the street. Maybe this is because I've needed to check my phone while
  crossing before but held out until it was "safe?"
- Whenever I use the bathroom (gross).
- When I finish an internal monologue/rant.
- When I fill up my water bottle.

So far today, I've checked my phone ~25 times. I'd wager that only a quarter of those
were me consciously deciding to do so.

Give it a try yourself. It's mildly surprising.

[Slow Horses](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HW7DZ2/) was exceptional. There were a ton of
one-off lines to the effect of, "this character said something cliché about the might
having fallen," which of course has the good parts of writing clichés without being...
you know.

# 3

I spent a lot of time the other day trying figure out triangle strips. I was eventually
successful, and now I have a hacked together thing that generates the landscape
(including its collider). Example:

![badly formatted](/files/ball.gif)

The other thing that I did ([source code
here](https://github.com/ethanrobison/utils/blob/master/ValidatedComponent.cs)) was a
custom `MonoBehaviour` C# attribute combo that enables one to auto-magically populate and
validate fields of type `Component` at run-time without having to do so oneself. I found
myself doing the construction

```C#
private Rigidbody2D _rb;

private void Start() {
    _rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    if (_rb == null) { throw new Exception(); }
}
```

... or something like it so many times that I eventually got tired of it. Reflection to
the rescue.


# 4

I learned today about [Warrant
Canaries](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq).

If you've never heard of them (and want to read my summary instead of the comprehensive
FAQ linked above), a warrant canary is a statement from someone online that they have
_not_ been subpoenaed by, e.g., the FBI. If the statement is ever not updated, then one
is to assume that there are some secret shenanigans going on. These statements are
important because saying that one is involved in a legal situation can be gagged, but it
(so far) seems unlikely that the governement will compel someone to lie.

This means that the best way to indicate to users that a website is under investigation
is to consistently post something saying that the website is not, and let its absence
speak volumes.

# 5

I'm supposed to play the brilliant [Baba is
You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/) and also the (hopefully
brilliant) [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://www.sekirothegame.com/). By supposed to I
mean that I myself have said that I need to do so. These games both look amazing, and I'm
really looking forward to seeing how they end up. If you've played either, drop me a line
(no spoilers, please!) and let me know what you think.

Instead of playing either of those, though, I've still been playing _Stardew Valley_ with
my partner.

# 6

I spent last Thursday hanging out at the Khan Academy office, since my good friend works
there (and I'm crashing on their couch). It's a nice place, and a seemingly un-evil sort
for a largeish tech company based in the Mountain View area. I ate their snacks and
played Dominion. I had a good time.

# 7

Currently spending a lot of time thinking about two things:

1) AI as we understand it in games is a pillar of design, much like sound and visuals.
Certain affective expectations are lumped up in genres, some of which would be
fundamentally altered by changes to the way that agents in the game behaved. Also,
human-level AI is _not_ necessarily the end game for agents. Also, also, if you're
interested at all in the idea of "AI as applied to arts, _not_ vis a vis what it can do
to reach human or superhuman levels," check out [Mateas' piece
here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6178/5bf318c5820f65126844adda2917d2b23927.pdf).

2) That modifications represent, among other things, a chance for players to customize
their own experience while playing a game. They're a way to construct a new identity, or
rather a way to adjust the construction of that identity, insofar as games are a way to
discover/experiment with or identities. There's more to be said here on mods, but I
ramble on...

# Signing Off

"Prospect and refuge" is an architectual idea that tries to capture what successful
structures should be like, vis a vis what sort of experiences they afford us, the
creatures inhabiting them. It's important for us, when we are looking for a place to go,
to make sure that it's got a bit of both going on. Until next time.


[^1]:
    Before you write an email re: media that subverts or the notion that plenty of people
    _deliberately_ consume works that are outside of their comfort zone, I'll do a
    half-baked clapback about how these sorts of things are satisfying the
    "entertainment" side of things, and that "agreeability" doesn't mean that it has to
    be an echo chamber. But I'm really just being preemptively feisty, and if I were a
    better content creator, I'd find a way of rephrasing this so that these ideas come
    along with the context that _this_ paragraph provides. Alas.
