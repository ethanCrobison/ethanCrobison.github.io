			<p>August was what kicked all this off. I responded to a reddit r/writingprompts post every day.*</p>

			<p>This is a list of the stories that I wrote. Today's gimmick is flip cards, so, uh, enjoy a series of 25 cards that you have to hover over to see the content. This is good design.</p>

			<p>*I suppose I really responded to one every day starting on the 5th of August, and I did miss a day or two, but I'm going to call that "all day," since it's close enough.</p>
